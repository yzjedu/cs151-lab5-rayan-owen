This lab taught us how to create an ATM in python. Displaying balance, depositing and withdrawals, while
error checking for invalid inputs. All parts of this code had to line up together. For example
if the withdrawal amount is larger than the balance we had to check for that. There were a alot of
ifs and elifs that was confusing to use, especially for error checking. Our expectations of how the code may work from the test cases
ended up working out. We got the outcome we expected, but it took longer than we expected.

Ray and I knew what we were supposed to do and what steps to take. Still,
the code ended up taking longer because of error checking. We were having a hard time error checking for the "deposit" option.
We couldn't figure out how to print an error message for invalid inputs. In the end, we fixed it and the code ran. I definitely
learned how and why the code worked after looking at it for so long.

Working with Ray this week was easy because we both have the same free time on Mondays.
We sat down and finished it in one sitting together.
