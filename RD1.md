* We were supposed to acomplish by bulding a simulation of an atm where users can view there balance, deposit money as well as withdrawing money. So we first started with our test cases to make sure to error check everything to make it sure it worked. Then we went into writing the algorithm. Since that was a success we were able to start writing our code. The results did match however it was hard to get to them. We ran into a couple road blocks but it was okay. The challenges we encouterned was defniitely organizing the error checking. We had a issue where we wanted to error check if someone entereed a negative number for depositing it would print a error statment. So that took us a while to fix. But then we used the same concepts with error checking with the depoit and used it with the withdrawl. I do think we learned what we were supposed to learn and acconplish. It was great working with Owen, we have good chemistry, we are able to work with eachother no matter the problem becuase we both are good listeners. Overall great project, not to hard, but has some challenge with it.
